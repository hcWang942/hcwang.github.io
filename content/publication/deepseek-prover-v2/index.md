abstract: This paper introduces DeepSeek-Prover-V2, an advanced large language model for formal mathematical reasoning. We enhance theorem-proving capabilities through a novel reinforcement learning approach focused on subgoal decomposition. By breaking complex theorems into manageable subgoals and training the model to recognize effective decomposition strategies, DeepSeek-Prover-V2 achieves significant improvements in proof success rates compared to previous models.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
